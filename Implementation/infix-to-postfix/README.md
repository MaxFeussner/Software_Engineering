Compile using:
  make
  
Execute using:
  ./infix-to-postfix -i input_file.txt -o output_file.txt
  
Include the input in the input_file.txt (or the name you want to give it)
Output will be generated in the file output_file.txt (or the name you want to give it)

If you don't specify one of those, the program will use the standard input/output.
