# Software_Engineering

Just Upload all the files for this module in this repository.  

We have to finish the design till 11.10.2019 23.59.   

- Andres will do the Interfaces  

- Juan will do the Diagramms  

- Max will do the requirements  

# Deliverable 2: Implementation

The second deliverable is the actual implementation of the system. Specifically, this should include:
- implementation of the 4 components in the C programming language
- **documented code, with each source code file containing the names of the authors/contributors**
- **a test suite containing a number of tests that follow the TAP protocol.**
- a Makefile that can be invoked, and which will compile the source code cleanly without errors
- **updated documentation**

Evaluation of the implementation will take place as follows; I expect to be able to run the following commands
- cd <whatever folder name you define>
- make # should be clean compilation
- make test # should run all tests; you are free to define multiple/different test targets

All functions should be documented: what parameters go in, what does it do, what is returned. 
All functions should have associated tests.
All files should have author information.
 
Please note that the final exam paper may include questions on any aspect of the project, and so your active participation in the project is required.
